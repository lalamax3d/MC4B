# MC4B

Forked from [FacialMotionCapture_v2](https://github.com/jkirsons/FacialMotionCapture_v2) for further experimentation and make it slightly more useable for myself. Following goals initially
- make it work with rigify facial rigs



# TODOS
- make setup easier ( convert to addon )
- make a basic panel
- draw marker Numbers on screen to decide, how to proceed
- map head orientation
- map jaw movement / rotation etc
- map lips controls
- map eyes controls
